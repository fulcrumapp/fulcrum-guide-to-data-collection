## Null Island
An invented geography with the coordinates 0°, 0°. Null Island is a concept derived from the results of geocoding data where the intended coordinates could not be matched for the entered address - resulting in a "0,0" being returned.

## Various Analysis Methods

## Assessment

## Method

## Monitoring
A repeated process or workflow which observes or records something.
## Piloting
Testing or trial of a process before fully conducting it.
## Sample / Sampling
An observation or collected record / the process of collecting data.
## Field
An element of a record, representing a single piece of data. Fields have different available types, including: 
* Text 
* Numeric
* Yes / No
* Label
* Single Choice
* Multiple Choice
* Classification Set
* Photo Fields
* Video
* Audio
* Barcode
* Date & Time
* Sections
## Sub-Field

## Calculation Field
Calculation fields can be used to write simple expressions to calculate values dynamically based on inputs given to other fields in your forms. This can be simple ‘total’ calculations or complex equations referencing other calculation fields and even data contained in repeatable sections. Calculated field expressions can be written in JavaScript, even as complex functions (and entire programs). ([Reference](http://www.fulcrumapp.com/help/calculation-fields/))
