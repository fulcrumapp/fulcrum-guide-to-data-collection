## Data Collection

## Ground Truthing
Verifying a record of observation directly at the subject's site.
## Null Island
An invented geography with the coordinates 0°, 0°. Null Island is a concept derived from the results of geocoding data where the intended coordinates could not be matched for the entered address - resulting in a "0,0" being returned.

* Date & Time
* Sections
## Sub-Field

## Calculation Field
Calculation fields can be used to write simple expressions to calculate values dynamically based on inputs given to other fields in your forms. This can be simple ‘total’ calculations or complex equations referencing other calculation fields and even data contained in repeatable sections. Calculated field expressions can be written in JavaScript, even as complex functions (and entire programs). ([Reference](http://www.fulcrumapp.com/help/calculation-fields/))
