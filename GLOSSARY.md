## CAD
Computer-aided design - CAD, utilizes computer software to facilitate drawing, analyzing, and disseminating technical designs. It is typically used in architectural, engineering, and machining workflows.
## Calculation Field
Calculation fields can be used to write simple expressions to calculate values dynamically based on inputs given to other fields in your forms. This can be simple ‘total’ calculations or complex equations referencing other calculation fields and even data contained in repeatable sections. Calculated field expressions can be written in JavaScript, even as complex functions (and entire programs). ([Reference](http://www.fulcrumapp.com/help/calculation-fields/))
