### The Value of Spatial Data

From planning where to put your new business to maximize traffic, to plotting the shortest route for a trip, knowing the world around you is crucial to making better business decisions.

Geographers use a variety of tools to collect, process, and analyze their data to create maps, charts, and graphs to empower decision makers to make more informed choices. Collectively known as GIS, these tools make use of **spatial data**, or data collected with a spatial component, in order to make their maps. Spatial data can be time consuming to collect, but is extremely valuable for an organization in a number of ways.

For many product businesses, maintaining an accurate inventory is crucial for knowing what items are in stock, but that same data can be used in ways that make the business even more efficient. For example, if one product sells more frequently in some locations but not in others, the spatial data can inform management to stock more in those locations, in order to maximize shelf space and reduce wasted product.

For a transportation company, knowing which roads are blocked, and the shortest path to a delivery, can be the $10,000 question. Being able to map routes, and alternate courses of travel can save hours of time, and gallons of fuel.

For those fighting pandemics, knowing where ill people reside, and where they've been can help researchers track down the cause and source of an pathogen, saving lives and preventing future outbreaks. 

In fact, this approach is the same used by epidemiologist Jon Snow, who identified the pump that was causing [London's Cholera outbreak in 1854](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak), by mapping the location of Cholera victims, and the pumps they used.
