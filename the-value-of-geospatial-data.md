### Planning and Tips of Data Collection

_The Planning Process_

Better tools encourage better processes. Platforms, like Fulcrum, encourage proactive approaches to the data collection process.

The act of sitting down and building your app forces you to think through the design of the data structure.

Engineers and scientists are tasked with solving problems and as consultants, often their only deliverable to the client is a report based on their findings. This report should be based on data that is clearly documented and can be independently reviewed. Fulcrum provides the tools that let professionals focus on their work without having to worry about technological hurdles.

While we tend to focus primarily on the data collection challenges, we must not forget about the rest of the data cycle. Once collected, the data must be processed or analyzed, so that it can be turned into actionable information. The standard workflow is to collect your data in the field with Fulcrum, then export it out for analysis in your favorite database, spreadsheet, or GIS application. If you need real-time analysis, we suggest integrating with a service such as [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/), via [data shares](http://localhost:4000/manual/data-shares/) or [webhooks](http://localhost:4000/developers/webhooks/).

Fulcrum is a hosted mobile forms platform that enables you to build custom apps for capturing information from the field. Design your forms using the intuitive, web-based drag-and-drop designer and deploy to your mobile workforce for gathering information like Text, Photos, SpatialVideo, SpatialAudio, Signatures, Barcodes, GPS Location, and more.

From asset management and inventory to environmental observations, field audits, and inspections, Fulcrum can record whatever you need from the field with full support for offline data collection and mapping. Access your live data feed for real time mapping or export your data and attachments in a variety of standard formats for further analysis. Fulcrum can be used as a standalone location-based data collection platform or integrated with existing services such as GIS and asset management systems.

Fulcrum is used by engineers, environmental researchers, power utilities, municipal governments, and many other professions across the world for complete management of field service operations. It is the perfect tool for asset management, field audits, inspections, and inventory applications.
