### The Value of Geospatial Data

_The Planning Process_

Better tools encourage better processes. Platforms, like Fulcrum, encourage proactive approaches to the data collection process.

The act of sitting down and building your app forces you to think through the design of the data structure, and the data you are trying to collect.

Engineers and scientists are tasked with solving problems and as consultants, often their only deliverable to the client is a report based on their findings. This report should be based on data that is clearly documented and can be independently reviewed. Fulcrum provides the tools that let professionals focus on their work without having to worry about technological hurdles.

While we tend to focus primarily on the data collection challenges, we must not forget about the rest of the data cycle. Once collected, the data must be processed or analyzed, so that it can be turned into actionable information. The standard workflow is to collect your data in the field with Fulcrum, then export it out for analysis in your favorite database, spreadsheet, or GIS application. If you need real-time analysis, we suggest integrating with a service such as [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/), via [data shares](http://localhost:4000/manual/data-shares/) or [webhooks](http://localhost:4000/developers/webhooks/).
