### Purpose <a id="Purpose"></a>

_What do I want to learn?_

Having a clear and defined **purpose** for your field data collection is imperative. On-the-ground and field surveys can be expensive, timewise and financially. You should clearly define your goals and objectives before conducting your data collection activities.

Begin defining your purpose by analyzing precisely what data you need to collect to answer the questions which have led you to this point originally. There will likely be additional data you _could_ collect while in the field but take caution against **mission creep**. Any additional data collected can quickly add to the time and money spent conducting your survey.

If what you're looking to learn can be determined back in the office - don't include it in your field data collection process. For example, why walk around a field to mark the corners and determine the area, when you can do that at a desk with GIS software?

### Survey Design <a id="Survey-Design"></a>

_Framing the question: What should I collect?_

How you setup your data collection survey will be critical to its success. The way you design how observations are recorded will have a tremendous impact on the way the data is collected and how its later processed and analyzed. An effective survey is one that is specific and focused; you don't want to get onto a tangent away from your original purpose. '_Nice to have_' information can quickly take away from the precious time it takes for your team to conduct the survey; it should be scrutinized as to whether it really needs to be captured.

For your questions, provide appropriate answer choices to pick from. This includes framing your questions fairly and being inclusive while also keeping them brief and direct. Consider how the data will be processed and analyzed as you're designing your survey. For example: do you want to allow a question to be answered with an open-ended response, or provide a range of structured answers to be chosen from instead?

Other things to consider surrounding your survey design include whether you will need supporting reference information while collecting the data. If a field user needs to confirm that they're within a certain area while collecting the observation - how will they be able to confirm that? Design and logistics go hand-in-hand. For example, will you be working in an area requiring access to cellular connectivity?

### Protocol <a id="Protocol"></a>

_How will I collect it?_

Your protocol should include training of the personnel who will be collecting your data. The level of understanding and competency your field staff possess will reflect itself in the quality of your data. It will be beneficial to have a longterm project timeline and schedule of daily activities.

Identify what personnel will be on your data collection team and determine if they will need to work together. Consider the logistics to safely and efficiently perform your survey. Your situation may warrant a team of two to have one driver and one person collecting data.

You may require certain conditions regarding weather and seasonality to be met before you _can_ or _cannot_ do your survey. As you define your procedure you will need to determine if you'll be collecting this data while driving in vehicles, on-foot, or perhaps remotely. Establish a schedule if there will be any revisit frequency to your data collection.

### Processing <a id="Processing"></a>

_How will I process the information?_

After the recorded observation is made, the data collection processing step begins. This step in the process can vary greatly depending on how the data is being collected and what's required to make the raw data usable. Placing emphasis upon optimal design and an effective protocol step will benefit the processing piece of your workflow. If your protocol dictates that data will be collected with paper and pencil, then you will require a processing task where results are transcribed into a computer spreadsheet or database.

Each additional step in the processing portion of data collection can introduce opportunities for error. Whether it's human-error while transferring data from paper to electronic form, or using incorrect parameters in a programmatic conversion - each step introduced also introduces an opportunity for error.

### Analysis <a id="Analysis"></a>

_What insights can I gather? What does the data suggest?_

After defining the original purpose for collecting, gathering, and processing your data - comes the analysis of the results. Analyzing the information collected from your survey provides the answer to what you were originally motivated to find out - and sometimes more! A thorough evaluation of the findings from your data may suggest conclusions which were only hypothesized before. If your analysis can replace subjective decision support with measurable facts, you will have more confidence.

### Distribution <a id="Distribution"></a>

_How will I share the data?_

After your data has been processed and analyzed, you will likely want to distribute or publish the findings. There are various methods to convey your results: tabular, map, charts, graphics, etc. Often, a combination of methods will be helpful to tell your story but it is important to use the right approach in order to achieve maximum effectiveness.

Not all data collection workflows are created equally! Some tools are built upon platforms which allow your data to be instantly distributed in a variety of formats once it's collected. There are also other downstream integrations to consider, such as the ability to publish your data once and then connect it to other 3-party services.
