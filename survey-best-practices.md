### Keep questions relevant and specific <a id="relevant"></a>
Ensure you're asking for pertinent information only. Avoid unnecessary details, feelings, and opinions unless they are important to your investigation.
### Make questions short <a id="short"></a>
Keep your inquiries as direct and to the point as possible. 
### Use simple language <a id="simple"></a>
Be clear and obvious about what you're asking. Avoid flowery language, terminology, and euphemisms, and ask questions in an unbiased, simple fashion.
### Ask about one thing at a time <a id="one-thing"></a>
One question, one answer. Ask for one thing at a time, and avoid open ended questions without a clear answer.
### Avoid biased language & leading questions <a id="biased"></a>
Phrase your questions to be considerate, inclusive, and respectful. Dont lead the question with unnecessary adjectives and adverbs that may bias a respondee's answer. Remain objective and avoid asking questions that may lead the subject to answer a particular way.
### Put questions in a positive form <a id="positive"></a>
It can be confusing to ask about _what is not_, instead ask about _what is_. 
### Offer a balanced set of responses <a id="balanced"></a>
Give a range of answers that are inclusive and fair.
