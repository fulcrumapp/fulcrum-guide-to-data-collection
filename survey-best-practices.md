### Keep questions relevant and specific <a id="relevant"></a>
Ensure you're asking for pertinent information only. Avoid unnecessary details, feelings, and opinions unless they are important to your investigation.
### Make questions short <a id="short"></a>
Keep your inquiries as direct and to the point as possible. 
### Use simple language <a id="simple"></a>
Be clear and obvious about what you're asking. Avoid flowery language, terminology, and euphemisms, and ask questions in an unbiased, objective fashion.
### Ask about only one thing at a time <a id="one-thing"></a>
One question, one answer. Ask for one thing at a time, and avoid open ended questions without a clear answer.

### Avoid biased language & leading questions <a id="biased"></a>
Phrase your questions to be considerate, inclusive, and respectful. Dont frame up or lead the question with unnecessary adjectives and adverbs that may bias a respondee's answer. Remain objective and avoid asking questions that may direct the subject to answer in a particular way.
### Put questions in a positive form <a id="positive"></a>
Phrasing questions in the negative can be confusing and may bias your responses. It can be confusing to ask about _what is not_, instead ask about _what is_. 
### Offer a balanced set of responses <a id="balanced"></a>
Give a range of answers that are inclusive and fair. Avoid errors of omission by including multiple options that cover all possible responses to your question.
### Add a comments section for field notes <a id="comments"></a>
Sometimes in the field, you might find important notes, data, or additional information you may want to relay to the analysts. Adding an optional comments section at the bottom of your survey allows your surveyors to add important information that otherwise might have been overlooked.
