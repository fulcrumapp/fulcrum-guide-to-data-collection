Having a clear and defined **purpose** for your field data collection is imperative. On-the-ground surveys can be expensive timewise and financially. You will want to clearly define goals and objectives before designing and conducting your data collection activities.

Identify what personnel will be on your data collection team and determine if they will need to work together. Consider the logistics to efficiently and safely perform your survey. It will be beneficial to have a longterm project timeline and schedule of daily activities.
