### Purpose <a id="Purpose"></a>

_What do I want to learn?_

Having a clear and defined **purpose** for your field data collection is imperative. On-the-ground surveys can be expensive timewise and financially. You should clearly define your goals and objectives before conducting your data collection activities.

Begin defining your purpose by analyzing precisely what data you need to collect to answer your questions which have led you to this point originally. There will likely be additional data you could collect while in the field but take caution against **mission creep**. Any additional data collected can quickly add to the time and money spent conducting your survey.

If what you're looking to learn can be determined back in the office - don't include it in your field data collection process. For example, why walk around a field to mark the corners and determine the area, when you can do that at a desk with GIS software?

_Framing the question: What should I collect?_

Will you need supporting reference data? Will you be working in an offline imagery? Will you need to connect to a custom maps server?

###Protocol <a id="Protocol"></a>

_How will I collect it?_

Identify what personnel will be on your data collection team and determine if they will need to work together. Consider the logistics to efficiently and safely perform your survey. It will be beneficial to have a longterm project timeline and schedule of daily activities.
