### Purpose <a id="Purpose"></a>

_What do I want to learn?_

Having a clear and defined **purpose** for your field data collection is imperative. On-the-ground surveys can be expensive, timewise and financially. You should clearly define your goals and objectives before conducting your data collection activities.

Begin defining your purpose by analyzing precisely what data you need to collect to answer the questions which have led you to this point originally. There will likely be additional data you could collect while in the field but take caution against **mission creep**. Any additional data collected can quickly add to the time and money spent conducting your survey.

If what you're looking to learn can be determined back in the office - don't include it in your field data collection process. For example, why walk around a field to mark the corners and determine the area, when you can do that at a desk with GIS software?

### Survey Design <a id="Survey-Design"></a>

_Framing the question: What should I collect?_

Will you need supporting reference data? Will you be working in an area requiring offline imagery? Will you need to connect to a custom maps server?

### Protocol <a id="Protocol"></a>

_How will I collect it?_

Your protocol should include training of the personnel who will be collecting your data. The level of understanding and competency your field staff possess will reflect itself in the quality of your data. It will be beneficial to have a longterm project timeline and schedule of daily activities. 

You may require certain conditions regarding weather and seasonality to be met before you _can_ or _cannot_ do your survey. As you define your procedure you will need to determine if you'll be collecting this data while driving in vehicles, on-foot, or perhaps remotely. Establish a schedule if there will be any revisit frequency to your data collection.

### Distribution <a id="Distribution"></a>

_Who will provide data? Who will collect data?_

Identify what personnel will be on your data collection team and determine if they will need to work together. Consider the logistics to safely and efficiently perform your survey. Your situation may warrant a team of two to have one driver and one person collecting data.

### Processing <a id="Processing"></a>

_How will we process the information?_

After the recorded observation is made, the data collection processing step begins. This step in the process can vary greatly depending on how the data is being collected and what's required to make the raw data usable. Placing emphasis upon optimal design and an effective protocol steps will benefit the processing step of your workflow. If your protocol dictates that data will be collected with paper and pencil, then you will require a processing step where results are transcribed into a computer spreadsheet or database.

Each additional step in the processing portion of data collection can introduce opportunities for error. Whether it's human-error while transferring data from paper to electronic form, or using incorrect parameters in a programmatic conversion - each step introduced also introduces an opportunity for error.

### Analysis <a id="Analysis"></a>

_What insights can we gather? What does the data suggest?_

After defining the original purpose for collecting, gathering, and processing your data - comes the analysis of the results. Analyzing the information collected from your survey provides the answer to what you were originally motivated to find out - and sometimes more! A thorough evaluation of the findings from your data may suggest conclusions which were only hypothesized before. If your analysis can replace subjective decision support with measurable facts, you can have more confidence.
