# “Learning the Dialogue” and the Technology

To understand data collection means knowing the lingo, technologies, and players which are prevalent in the industry today. It is important to stay up-to-date with the latest terminology and emerging companies. Acquisitions occur *often*, new innovations are springing-up almost *daily*, and handfuls of startups come and go *overnight*.

>Always keep one foot in the past, your head in the present, and your eyes to the future.

However, there is a balance to staying informed. It can be overwhelming to keep up with every new buzzword or piece of vaporware which scrolls across your timeline. Try to ascertain what tools and techniques are prominent, dependable, and prolific in your field - **today**.

Find a few leaders, innovators, or bloggers related to your industry and keep up with the material they're talking about. If you're from the government sector, consider researching workflows similar to yours and how they're executed in the private industry. Try to attend tradeshows or conferences. Nothing is better then meeting people face-to-face who're doing similar work and exchanging lessons-learned.
