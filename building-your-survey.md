# Building Your Survey

The best approach to building surveys is work backwards. Identify what you want to learn and how you want to measure results before you begin designing a survey. By building surveys with end goals in mind will hep you locate which piece of data you should collect, and how you can structure your survey for the best results when its time to collect data in the field. 


## **What do you want to learn?**



The first step in building your survey is identifying exactly what you want to learn. By starting at the end, you can visualize how you want to present your information and come to a logical conclusion about how to proceed and what to collect. Here's a few examples that we can develop throughout this section:

**Examples**

* Are you trying to learn more political opinions within an population?*
 
* Are you trying to map fire hydrants in a specific area?*



## **What metrics will you use**

The next step is to identify metrics that will guide your decision making. Identifying these before conducting your survey will insure objectivity in your survey, by not biasing the reporting with after-the-fact analysis. The point in conducting a survey is to gain real-world knowledge, not to prove your point. If your data supports your hypothesis, great! If it doesnt, its never advisable to contort the metrics just to support your position. Also, avoid framing questions in a way that leads people to a desired conclusion, to avoid bias in your data.

## **How should you lay it out**
