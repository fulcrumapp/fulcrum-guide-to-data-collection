# Building Your Survey

The best approach to building surveys is work backwards. Identify what you want to learn and how you want to measure results before you begin designing a survey. By building surveys with end goals in mind will hep you locate which piece of data you should collect, and how you can structure your survey for the best results when its time to collect data in the field. 


## **What do you want to learn?**

The first step in building your survey is identifying exactly what you want to learn. By starting at the end, you can visualize how you want to present your information and come to a logical conclusion about how to proceed and what to collect. Create a hypothesis that is testable and measurable, and from that determine what data you'd need to collect.

A project trying to gather information on fire risk may want to map out quantitative information on hydrants and fire prevention equipment within an area. A political poll trying to map out supporters might want to gather qualitative data on opinions and party affiliations without biasing the responses. 

Understanding what you want to learn is crucial to determine what you need to collect, as it allows you to properly frame up your survey and collect data that is relevant for examining your hypothesis.

## **What metrics will you use**

The next step is to identify metrics that will guide your decision making. Identifying these before conducting your survey will insure objectivity in your survey, by not biasing the reporting with after-the-fact analysis. The point in conducting a survey is to gain real-world knowledge, not to prove your point. 

If your data supports your hypothesis, great! If it doesn't, its never advisable to contort the metrics just to bend data to support your position. Also, avoid framing questions in a way that leads people to a desired conclusion, to avoid bias in your data.


## **What data should you collect**

Identifying the pieces of data you need to collect in the field is the next crucial step. Often times, people make 2 missteps at this process. They either try to collect everything they can, or as little as they can, and both of these approaches can cause problems. 

Trying to collect too little field information can make your survey lack sufficient data for a meaningful answer, while collecting too much data can lead to people terminating a survey midway through. Get a feel for the time it takes to complete the survey by practicing your questions on a friend or coworker, in order to produce a survey is quick and thorough. 

Try to isolate the minimum amount of key data needed for your project, and add a few additional fields or a comment section as well, so your survey gatherers can take notes or collect other insightful data in the field. 

## **How should you lay it out**

The way you format and layout your survey can help save time and reduce the work needed to collect data in the field. We'll focus on 4 major ways to improve the collection speed: **Chunking, Labeling, Skip Logic** and **Calculation Fields**

**Chunking** is the grouping of similar questions in a cluster, which helps organize your survey conceptually and allows it to flow easier. If you have 5 questions on history, and 5 questions on politics in your survey, grouping them into 2 clusters will help in the field. This way [REASON]
