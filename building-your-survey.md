# Building Your Survey

The best approach to building a survey is to work backwards. Identify what you want to learn and how you want to measure results before you begin designing. By building surveys with end goals in mind, it will help you locate which piece of data you should collect, and how you can structure your survey for the best results when its time to collect data in the field.

## What do I want to learn? 

The first step in building your survey is identifying exactly what you want to learn. By starting at the end, you can visualize how you want to present your information and come to a logical conclusion about how to proceed and what to collect. Create a hypothesis that is testable and measurable, and from that determine what data you'd need to collect.

A project trying to gather information on 'fire risk' may want to map out quantitative information on hydrants and fire prevention equipment within an area. A political poll trying to map out supporters might want to gather qualitative data on opinions and party affiliations without biasing the responses.

Understanding what you want to learn is crucial to determine what you need to collect, as it allows you to properly frame up your survey and collect data that is relevant for examining your hypothesis.

## What metrics should I use?

The next step is to identify metrics that will guide your decision making. Identifying these before conducting your survey will ensure objectivity in your survey, by not biasing the reporting with after-the-fact analysis. The point in conducting a survey is to gain real-world knowledge, not to prove your point.

If your data supports your hypothesis, great! If it doesn't, its never advisable to contort the metrics just to bend data to support your position. Also, avoid framing questions in a way that leads people to a desired conclusion, to avoid bias in your data.

## What data should I collect?

Identifying the pieces of data you need to collect in the field is the next step. Often times, people make 2 missteps at this process. They either try to collect everything they can, or as little as they can, and both of these approaches can cause problems.

Trying to collect too little field information can make your survey lack sufficient data for a meaningful answer, while collecting too much data can lead to people terminating a survey midway through. Get a feel for the time it takes to complete the survey by practicing your questions on a friend or coworker, in order to produce a survey that is quick and thorough.

Try to isolate the minimum amount of key data needed for your project, and add a few additional fields or a comment section as well, so your survey gatherers can take notes or collect other insightful data in the field.

## How should I lay out my survey?

The way you format and layout your survey can help save time and reduce the work needed to collect data in the field. We'll focus on 4 major ways to improve the collection speed of your survey: **Chunking, Labeling, Skip Logic** and **Calculation Fields**.

**Chunking** is the grouping of similar questions in a cluster, which helps organize your survey conceptually and allows it to flow easier. If you have 5 questions on history, and 5 questions on politics in your survey, grouping them into 2 clusters make logical sense, and will reduce the time needed to collect information in the field.

**Labeling** is the method of adding a label to chunks of questions you've already grouped together. This helps the surveyor understand the purpose behind the various of blocks of questions they are collecting, and gives them an idea as to how far along they are in the survey. When a survey is well labeled, a surveyor can parse a long question set easily, and find a specific question without having to read each question and entry to find a piece of information later on.

**Skip Logic** is the use of questions that opens or closes other questions in the survey depending on the answer. If a person answers a question that makes later questions irrelevant, skip logic allows you to bypass those questions entirely, rather than wasting time scrolling past those questions and increasing the likelihood of missing key information.

**Calculation Fields** allow you to conduct simple or complex calculations instantly by using your other questions as inputs. Rather than having to tally up responses by hand, or use a calculator to determine the volume or area of a space for example, a calculation field can be used to take your initial measurements and generate an answer instantly. This is really useful for individuals in engineering and construction who have to take specific measurements and create an estimate.
