# Building Your Survey

The best approach to building surveys is work backwards. Identify what you want to learn and how you want to measure results before you begin designing a survey. By building surveys with end goals in mind will hep you locate which piece of data you should collect, and how you can structure your survey for the best results when its time to collect data in the field. 


## **What do you want to learn?**


The first step in building your survey is identifying exactly what you want to learn. By starting at the end, you can visualize how you want to present your information and come to a logical conclusion about how to proceed and what to collect. Create a hypothesis that is testable and measurable, and from that determine what data you'd need to collect.

A project trying to gather information on fire risk may want to map out quantitative information on hydrants and fire prevention equipment within an area. A political poll trying to map out supporters might want to gather qualitative data on opinions and party affiliations without biasing the responses. 

Understanding what you want to learn is crucial to determine what you need to collect, as it allows you to properly frame up your survey and collect data that is relevant for examining your hypothesis.

## **What metrics will you use**

The next step is to identify metrics that will guide your decision making. Identifying these before conducting your survey will insure objectivity in your survey, by not biasing the reporting with after-the-fact analysis. The point in conducting a survey is to gain real-world knowledge, not to prove your point. 

If your data supports your hypothesis, great! If it doesn't, its never advisable to contort the metrics just to bend data to support your position. Also, avoid framing questions in a way that leads people to a desired conclusion, to avoid bias in your data.
