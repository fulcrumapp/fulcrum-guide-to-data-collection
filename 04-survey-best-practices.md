### Keep questions relevant and specific <a id="relevant"></a>

Ensure you're asking for pertinent information only. Avoid unnecessary details, feelings, and opinions unless they are important to your investigation.

### Make questions short <a id="short"></a>

Keep your questions as direct and to the point as possible. The more pointed the question, the less risk there is of a collector mis-reading the question and answering incorrectly. Breaking up a survey into many smaller questions versus fewer longer ones also results in richer, more useful data in the end.

### Use simple language <a id="simple"></a>

Be clear and obvious about what you're asking. Avoid flowery language, terminology, and euphemisms, and ask questions in an unbiased, objective fashion. Sometimes technical jargon may be required, but keep in mind the audience that's being asked to complete the survey. Is the question something they'll understand?

### Ask about one thing at a time <a id="one-thing"></a>

One question, one answer. Ask for one thing at a time, and avoid open-ended questions without a clear answer. If you are proofing this, send me a message with the word "Read it"

### Avoid biased language & leading questions <a id="biased"></a>

Phrase your questions to be considerate, inclusive, and respectful. Don't frame up or lead the question with unnecessary adjectives and adverbs that may bias a respondee's answer. Remain objective and avoid asking questions that may direct the subject to answer in a particular way.

### Put questions in a positive form <a id="positive"></a>

Phrasing questions negatively can be confusing and may bias your responses. It can be confusing to ask about _what is not_, instead ask about _what is_. If you can reduce questions down to a binary "yes or no" question, that makes things even simpler for the collector to understand.

### Consider the ordering of questions

The order in which you display the fields on your survey form can make the difference between correct and inaccurate data. This is where field testing helps to iterate in your design process and get the structure just right. For ease-of-use, most of the time your questions should flow in the order the collector typically conducts the survey. If they're doing a construction site walkthrough inspection, structure the survey in the order the inspector moves through the site.

### Offer a balanced set of responses <a id="balanced"></a>

Give a range of answers that are inclusive and thorough. Avoid errors of omission by including multiple options that cover all possible responses to your question. Using an "Other" option within picklists helps avoid getting overly specific in preset picklist options.

### Add a comments section for field notes <a id="comments"></a>

Sometimes in the field, you might find important notes, data, or additional information you may want to relay to the analysts. An optional comments section at the bottom of your survey allows surveyors to add important information that otherwise might have been overlooked. It functions as a good catch-all for anything your survey model might not have accommodated for.
