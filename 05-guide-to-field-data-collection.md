# Guide to Field Data Collection

In our previous chapters we've outlined the basics of data collection, building your survey, and some best practices. This chapter contains our recommendations for gathering data once you're out in the field.

* [Identifying Parameters and Range](#parameters-and-range) - define the scope of your data collection.
* [Plotting Course](#plotting-course) - optimize your field crew deployments.
* [Using Basemaps](#basemaps) - provide context and reference for your team.
* [Exporting the Data](#exporting) - get your data out in various formats.
* [Importing into Other Platforms](#importing) - load your data into other programs and services.

### Identifying Parameters and Range <a id="parameters-and-range"></a>

As outlined in [Data Collection 101](https://fulcrumapp.gitbooks.io/fulcrum-guide-to-data-collection/content/02-data-collection-101.html#Survey-Design), your survey design will dictate the details and scope of what you will collect. It is important to conform to the standards set forth in your survey design to ensure consistency of the data collected by you and others on your team. Going outside the identified parameters and range can skew your data and potentially compromise the results of your final analysis.

### Plotting Course <a id="plotting-course"></a>

Before you depart for your data collection mission, it may seem obvious that you know 'where' you're going to do your work, but there is more to it than that. Having a plan before you start gathering data in the field is an essential first step. A few things you'll want to take into consideration are: how many hours in the day it will be possible to collect data, the spatial relationship between collection sites, and how long it takes to complete your survey at each location. Does it makes more sense to travel to the furthest location first - and work backwards? Certainly if you have multiple sites to visit, there will be an optimal route you can take rather than doing so in a random order.

Other logistics to include in your planning:
* Do you have any needed permission, codes, or keys for access to sites on private property?
* Will you need protection from the elements, pests or animals, etc.?
* What is your plan in the case of an emergency or injury?
* (If traveling by vehicle) Is your vehicle properly maintained, capable, and with adequate fuel?
